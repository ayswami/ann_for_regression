Developing a neural network for solving a regression problem

We have imported sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, 
keras, pandas libraries in the code2.py file.

To execute the program successfully it is 
mandatory to have the kc_house_data.csv file 
to be present in the same directory as the 
code2.py file. 

This code has been created using vs code ide.
The code involves data reading, splitting, 
cleaning, plotting accuracies for various 
hyperparameter variations on the neural network.
At last, the manual grid serach method is used 
to find the best parameters.
